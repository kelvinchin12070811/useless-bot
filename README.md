# Useless Bot

Hi there! This is the Useless Bot, a discord bot that have no specific goal! A discord bot that is primally build
because the owner want to learn Rust! As the name mentioned, we have no idea what it can do, nor what it will do.
Features will be randomly added for fun, or just want to see "what will happened"!

The project is basically inspired by ntietz's blog --
[Write more "useless" software](https://ntietz.com/blog/write-more-useless-software/) where the goal to learn something
by building some "shit". It might not useful, but it was "fun to build" is the goal!
